      <description>Hello, this is the second post in the #Language series. The first post was about understanding probabilities such as joints, marginals and conditional probabilities using english letters. We were able to answer questions such as:
What is the most common occuring english letter in all english words ? What is the most likely next letter given that the current letter i&amp;rsquo;m observing is say &amp;rsquo;e&amp;rsquo; ? What was the most likely previous letter given that the current letter i&amp;rsquo;m observing is say &amp;lsquo;j&amp;rsquo; ?</description>

      <description>Welcome to my first blog post in this series on text processing! In this series, I will explore the fascinating world of natural language processing, from the basics of language and words to more advanced concepts like text modeling and language generation.
In this first blog post, we will focus on the fundamental building blocks of language - letters - and how we can use them to understand probabilities. We will then move on to text modeling, which involves using statistical methods to analyze and understand natural language, and finally, we will try to build a simple language generator.</description>

      <description>Ernest P. Chan on Financial Machine Learning Link to heading It is quite hard to apply ML in Finance, in order to get some value.
Simple linear models, and strategies (simplicity is in linear, parsimonious models), such as pairs trading using OLS to compute hedge ratios, and use bollinger bands to detect reversion to mean. Since more and more people, get in the game, there is [[Strategy decay]], making the strategies become less and less profitable.</description>

      <description>Episode 52: How to develop quantitative trading strategies - Ernest P. Chan Link to heading Data in finance is sparse, as compared to other domains, e.g trading data of Daily frequency is limited in backtesting, hence you need market intuition. Intra-day trading, is useful since it presents many trading opportunity i.e. Trades are held for hours. Seperate asset classes, and even securities could demand different models. Run stocks in market neutral strategies.</description>

      <description>Reference: BEST PRACTICES IN RESEARCH FOR QUANTITATIVE EQUITY STRATEGIES
Taxonomy is simply a classification of something.
Strategies differ in their motivation to trade, information used to trade,and the instrunments traded. Metrics such as: trading frequencies, and holding periods are functions of the investment theory underlying the strategy. Multifactor strategies: Models which invest in equities based on multiple characteristics that replicate how investors make decisions. Allocation strategies: Strategies which make decisions based on allocations to different variables eg.</description>

      <description>Question: As a successful quant trader, do you constantly develop new trading strategies?
Answer: By Tom Costello
(https://www.quora.com/As-a-successful-quant-trader-do-you-constantly-develop-new-trading-strategies)
The short answer is “You had better if you want to keep working.” but I can add some color there.
There is something in ‘quant trading’ called the ‘system’ or ‘program’ lifecycle.
A true ‘quant trading program’ identifies systemic pricing inefficiency. But as you participate in that market and take a profit for yourself, the presence of your buy and sell orders makes the pricing more efficient.</description>

      <description>Question: Do you make money by algorithmic trading, is what Paul Sutton said true?
Answer: By Tom Costello
(https://www.quora.com/Do-you-make-money-by-algorithmic-trading-is-what-Paul-Sutton-said-true
For the largest part I’d have to agree with Paul’s conclusion. His research is more directly empirical, but is completely consistent with my theory on how markets work, and their evolution over time. There isn’t any way I can think of for the typical individual stock trader to pursue ‘algorithmic trading’ in a manner that will lead to greater profit.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 7 Link to heading For many problems in predictive analysis, the variation in response can be explained by the independent variables working together, however for certain variation in the response variable, it has to be explained by the joint workings of two or more variables together.
Two or more predictors are said to interact if their combined effect is different (less or greater) than what we would expect if we were to add the impact of each of their effects when considered alone.</description>
