    </header>

    <p>My name is Stanley Sayianka, an aspiring machine learning research scientist. I am a data scientist trained in statistical methods,
with a focus on quantitative finance (so far). I thoroughly enjoy studying machine learning, and strive to
combine it with my daily experiences in order to deliver valuable insights to the issues facing the environment I operate in.
In my studies, I love exploring how learning algorithms actually <em>learn</em>, how they respond to changes, and how they <em>evolve</em> to handle the ever-growing complexity of the real world.
My interests lie in: Machine learning, probabilistic(<em>bayesian</em>) reasoning, information theory, and algorithmic trading.
In my free time, I love hanging out with friends, and skating.
Above all, I am a born-again christian, who embraces the principles of integrity, humility, diligence, hard work and trust in God in whatever I do.</p>
