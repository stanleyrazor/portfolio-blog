<p><a href="https://stanleyrazor.github.io/portfolio-blog/pfiles/gmv-report.html"><strong>A COMPARISON OF COVARIANCE MATRIX ESTIMATION METHODS FOR TANGENCY PORTFOLIOS</strong></a></p>
<p>This research article investigates the problem of covariance matrix estimation for tangency portfolios using data from the NSE. Specifically, we compare several methods of covariance matrix estimation and evaluate their performance in constructing tangency portfolios. The results of our study provide insights into the most effective methods for estimating the covariance matrix in the context of the NSE, which can be valuable for portfolio managers and investors seeking to optimize their investments in the East African region.</p>

<p><a href="https://stanleyrazor.github.io/portfolio-blog/pfiles/exposure-to-crypto.pdf"><strong>AN EXPOSURE-TO-CRYPTO STRATEGY</strong></a></p>
<p>This is a backtest analysis for a strategy which explores systematic exposure to the crypto asset class subject to minimum acceptanle return and downside risk constraints using the hypothesis drive development approach. The strategy achieves its objective by exploiting the high correlation existing in the crypto-market. The models used include: cointegration, regression, and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</p>

<p><a href="https://stanleyrazor.github.io/portfolio-blog/pfiles/high-dimensional-ml.pdf"><strong>LEARNING REPRESENTATIONS IN HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA</strong></a></p>
<p>This study explores models suitable for high-dimensional data, where several challenges such as multi-collinearity and over-fitting are inherent.
The dataset used for accomplishing the project is a high-dimensional finance dataset,
where the task is predicting quarterly returns and direction. The models considered in the study include: Ridge regression,
LASSO regression, PCA, Kernel-PCA, and ICA.</p>

<p><a href="https://stanleyrazor.github.io/portfolio-blog/pfiles/modelling-liability.pdf"><strong>MODELLING LIABILITY CLAIM SEVERITY USING THE GAMMA FAMILY OF DISTRIBUTIONS</strong></a></p>
<p>This study seeks to model claim severity from a portfolio of liability insurance policies
in Kenya  from the period 1980 to 2022. The loss models fitted from the data are selected from the Gamma family of distributions
due to their positive skewness and heavy-tailedness. Models explored in this study are: The exponential distribution,
the Gamma distribution, the Weibull distribution, the Pareto distribution and the Burr distribution.</p>

<p><a href="https://stanleyrazor.github.io/portfolio-blog/pfiles/tracking-error-strategy.pdf"><strong>AN E.T.F TRACKING ERROR STRATEGY</strong></a></p>
<p>This study seeks to construct an active trading strategy which takes advantage of the tracking error
of listed Exchange Traded Funds, with the baskets that those funds track. Regression modelling is applied to quantify
the pricing discrepancy. A strategy is then constructed to enable a fund manager enter long and short positions, with an aim of bagging risk-free trading profit.
The ETF investigated is the ABSA NEW GOLD ETF, listed in the NSE, which tracks the gold bullion.</p>

<p>This study explores the prescence of arbitrage opportunities in the Nairobi Securities Exchange,
and seeks to come up with active trading strategies to profit from the pricing inefficiencies.
Models utilized include: regression models, auto-regressive models, and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model
for mean reverting processes.</p>

<p><a href="https://stanleyrazor.github.io/portfolio-blog/pfiles/social-media-insurance.pdf"><strong>SOCIAL MEDIA INSURACE: INSURING REPUTATION IN A DIGITAL AGE</strong></a></p>
<p>This aim of this study was to come up with an insurance product for insuring social media risks, such as:
online impersonation, online abuse, and web application attacks. This comes at a time when the number of internet users in Kenya is growing at an geometric growth rate.
The product targeted social media influencers, politicians and celebrities and the general
public exposed to social media risks in Kenya. This study utilized the Bayesian modelling framework
and actuarial pricing principles.</p>

<p><a href="https://stanleyrazor.github.io/portfolio-blog/pfiles/kenya-demography.html"><strong>ANALYSIS OF POPULATION SIZE AND RELATED FACTORS - KENYA</strong></a></p>
<p>This is an exploratory data analysis project which investigates the population size of Kenya since the year 1960,
as well as several demographic variables such as fertility, mortality and migration. Population projection models
are fitted to the data including: mathematical models, time series models and regression models,
in an attempt to project the one-year population size.</p>

<p><a href=""><strong>IMPROVING PSV INSURANCE IN KENYA</strong></a></p>
<p>This project was presented during the annual product  development competition of Kenyatta University Actuarial Students'
Association (ASSK) on financial inclusivity in insurance, where it was awarded the best project. The aim of the
project was to improve PSV(Public transport) insurance using deep learning. This was accomplished by using surveillance
data feeds from CCTV cameras located in major kenyan highways and roads in Nairobi, Kenya to detect over-speeding, over-loading and
dangerous driving among PSV drivers.</p>

<p><a href=""><strong>THE EFFECTS OF SOCIAL MEDIA TAX ON THE QUALITY OF TWEETS IN UGANDA</strong></a></p>
<p>This study focused on analyzing the effects of the social media tax imposed on Ugandan internet users (July, 2018)
on the quality of tweets in Uganda. We use the Kenyan twitter population as a benchmark. I undertook
the project during my Global Summer Institute with Equitech Futures.</p>

<p><a href=""><strong>CONSTRUCTING A BAYESIAN NEAREST NEIGHBOUR MODEL</strong></a></p>
<p>The aim of this  project was to improve the current K nearest neighbours algorithm to enable an analyst encode prior beliefs
about the classes present in the data, which leads to the adoption of Bayes rule in the standard kNN model.</p>

<p><a href=""><strong>SURVEYING EXPERT SYSTEMS: RULES AND KNOWLEDGE BASE</strong></a></p>
<p>This was a project aimed at investigating how expert systems work. I accomplished this by designing a popular
board game we would play in our childhood days. The game agent was explicitly fed with game rules (<em>skills</em>), and optimal
paths to take in order to attack the opponent or defend its positions. The agent (<em>using the rules</em>), self-played
against itself in order to construct a knowledge base (<em>experience</em>).</p>

<p><a href=""><strong>DUPLICATE FINDER</strong></a></p>
<p>The aim of this project was to construct a duplicate finder algorithm for textual data (<em>dataset with usernames</em>), in
order to identify duplicataes in textual data with no primary key. The solution lied in building a nearest neighbour algorithm
which utilized string distances to find duplicates in textual data.</p>
